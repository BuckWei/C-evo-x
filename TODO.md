# TODO

 - Find source code for StdAI.dll.

 - Audit case of filenames, unit names and other file inclusions.

 - Audit unit names; unit names should match file names.

 - Remove `Integrated.dpr`.

 - Determine if resources in `Res1.rc` (drag.cur, flathand.cur) are used.

 - Add sizes larger than 32x32 to `cevoxp2.ico`.

 - Ordinals in `cevo.res` don't match the original; is this important?.

 - Check ordinals in `Res1.res` against original `RES1.RES`.

 - Relocate C# `obj\` directories out of source tree, into `tmp\`.
